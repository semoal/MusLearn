 When the passing looks to die for
 
Take it in your heart now lover
 
When the case is out
 
And you're tired and sodden
 
Take it in your heart, take it in your heart
 

 
Back to when it was cool
 
'Cause there's no substitute
 
Who even knows the truth?
 
The truth, the truth
 

 
Take it in your heart now, lover
 
Take it in your heart (heart, heart, heart)
 
Take it in your heart
 
Take it in your heart (heart, heart, heart)
 
Where it all goes down
 

 
Outside cold, it ghost in now, it jet lag
 
I took it to the right man
 
Took it all back
 
When the courts were closing, it was Bobby gracing
 
I know that
 
I put it to the right man
 
He put it back
 

 
Caught in your eyes, stacks of lights
 
Come streaming back
 
Make it for the best times
 
Growing pains, good times
 
Good times, good times
 
Good times, good times
 
Good times
 

 
Take it in your heart now, lover
 
Take it in your heart (heart, heart, heart)
 
Take it in your heart
 
Take it in your heart (heart, heart, heart)
 
Where it all goes down
 

 
Andromeda, Andromeda, Andromeda
 
Take it in your heart now, lover
 
Andromeda, Andromeda, Andromeda, Andromeda
 
Take it in your heart, take it in your heart
 
Where it all goes down
