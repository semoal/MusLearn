 Don't you know, that you blow my mind?
 
Honey, you're sweeter, than anything, I need you.
 
Want to, get closer, to you, to you,
 
To you, I want to get closer to you now.
 

 
Love you, I need you, I think I wanna squeeze you nightly, so tightly.
 
Girl you know you really blow my mind.
 

 
Say it again,
 
Just one more time I've got to know,
 
How you came to blow my mind.
 
Closer.
 

 
Pleasure, passion,
 
Tonight's the night I'm looking for your action.
 
I want to, hold you,
 
Don't you know that now you blow my mind?
 

 
Say it again,
 
Just one more time I've got to know,
 
How you came to blow my mind.
 
Closer.
 

 
Fever, high now,
 
Help me wipe the sweat away from my brow.
 
Sexy, oh, lady,
 
Don't you know this time you blow my mind?
 

 
Oh, don't you know, yeah,
 
Don't you know by now that now you blow my mind, yeah.
 
Oh yes you do, yes you do, yes you blow my mind.
